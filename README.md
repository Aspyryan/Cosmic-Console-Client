Minecraft Console Client
========================

Minecraft Console Client(MCC) is a lightweight app allowing you to connect to any Minecraft server,
send commands and receive text messages in a fast and easy way without having to open the main Minecraft game. It also provides various automation for administration and other purposes.

## How to change server ip

Go to the MinecraftClient.ini file and open it with any text editor you like. Go to the line with "serverip=" and change the value behind the "=" without a space to the server ip you like!

## License

Unless specifically stated, the code is from the MCC developers, and available under CDDL-1.0.
Else, the license and original author are mentioned in source file headers.
The main terms of the CDDL-1.0 license are basically the following:

- You may use the licensed code in whole or in part in any program you desire, regardless of the license of the program as a whole (or rather, as excluding the code you are borrowing). The program itself may be open or closed source, free or commercial.
- However, in all cases, any modifications, improvements, or additions to the CDDL code (any code that is referenced in direct modifications to the CDDL code is considered an addition to the CDDL code, and so is bound by this requirement; e.g. a modification of a math function to use a fast lookup table makes that table itself an addition to the CDDL code, regardless of whether it's in a source code file of its own) must be made publicly and freely available in source, under the CDDL license itself.
- In any program (source or binary) that uses CDDL code, recognition must be given to the source (either project or author) of the CDDL code. As well, modifications to the CDDL code (which must be distributed as source) may not remove notices indicating the ancestry of the code.
